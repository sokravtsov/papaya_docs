Papaya is an infrastructure for stablecoin subscriptions. It enables merchants to accept recurring payments from millions of users and collect them in a single transaction, for less than $0.01 in gas. Our subscription protocol enables real-time balance calculations for any user without the need to iterate through all incoming streams. This means you can manage subscriptions for millions of users without enumerating each individual subscription.&#x20;
