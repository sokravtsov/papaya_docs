Papaya's real-time payment streaming revolutionizes the way subscriptions are managed and processed. Here's how it works and why it benefits both businesses and customers:

---

## **How Real-Time Streaming Works**

- Payments are streamed in real-time directly from the subscriberâ€™s wallet to the business.
- Instead of traditional fixed billing cycles (e.g., monthly), funds flow continuously.
- The payment stream stops automatically when the subscription is canceled or the balance is depleted.
