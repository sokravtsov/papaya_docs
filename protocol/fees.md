Papaya was designed with the authors community in mind, enabling them to build and manage their own platforms, such as blogs and social networks. Also, to incentivize platform owners, the protocol allows for the collection of fees from each author .&#x20;

When setting up a subscription, it is essential to specify the project associated with the author. The subscriber pays the requested amount, from which both the author and the platform receive their respective shares.&#x20;
