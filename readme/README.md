# Introduction

In Web2 payment systems, each subscription must be claimed individually, meaning that you can only determine whether a subscription payment will be successful, such as if there are sufficient funds on the card, at the moment of processing.

Web3 subscriptions, on the other hand, are built on a protocol with a unique operating algorithm, representing an innovation in accounting. It ensures data consistency, as the data cannot be altered in a way that would break the system. Auditors guarantee that the smart contract operates consistently and reliably.

Our goal was to optimize the claiming process by consolidating multiple claims into a single short transaction, allowing us to collect payments from all subscribers at once, rather than processing each one individually.
